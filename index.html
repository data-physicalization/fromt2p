                        <h2>Call for Participation</h2>
                        <p>It has been almost a decade since the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2702123.2702180"><i>"Opportunities and Challenges for Data Physicalization"</i></a> article. In this time, physicalization research has seen an uptake in interest, which has resulted in answers to previous challenges as well as new opportunities. Thus, this workshop explores four key grand challenges based on literature and a previous workshop: privacy, temporality, collaborative sense-making, and sustainability. Through discussions and the creation of physicalizations that embody these challenges, we will explore sub-challenges, potential solutions, and new opportunities. We invite experts in physicalization and the relevant domains, as well as designers and artists, to join us for this one-day workshop. </br></br>

                        If you are interested in participating, please submit a 2-page position paper (excluding references) or another medium that fits your work (e.g., video or motivation letter) that discusses at least one of the following: (i) one or more of the listed grand challenges of physicalization; (ii) how your research resonates with these challenges; (iii) your experience or vision on how these grand challenges influence the design of a physicalization, or (iv) any other grand challenges you see ahead for physicalization research. Submissions should be submitted via <a href=https://forms.gle/5cXZYthbRHDGz1ES6>this Google form.</a> </br></br>

                        Successful submissions will be selected based on their ability to trigger discussion and will be published on the workshop's website. For each accepted submission, at least one author must attend the workshop. All participants must register for the workshop and at least one conference day. </br></br>
    
                        More information can be found in our <a href="files/DIS_Workshop%20Proposal.pdf">workshop proposal</a>.</p>
